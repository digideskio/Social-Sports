Mobile User Interface
=====================

Running the Mobile User Interface:
1. Open a mobile web browser or emulator.
2. Navigate the browser to login.html (There is no username/password checking.
   You can enter anything you want.)

Please note that some pages (login-failed.html, groups-declined.html) are not
accessible by clicking the links in the UI as there is no business logic in the
UI.  Just open these files manually in the browser.
